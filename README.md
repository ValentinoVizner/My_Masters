It's written in Croatian, but the most important things (goals and what has been accomplished) i will explain through Jupyter Notebooks.<br />
<br />
Here is the summary:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quantitative data are the basic step for processing, storage and a graphical representation
of GPS data of traffic entities within the traffic system. For a good estimate of average
speeds, travel time and the level of reliability during the day a sufficient number data are needed
for each road segment. Also, adequate information-communication system is required, that will
filter, process and store the data in the relational database and display the results to the end user
in the developed application. Mathematical methods for filtering data with appropriate formulations
are presented together with processing and graphical presentation of the results. After
processing, the processed data are be stored in the relational database PostgreSQL together with
processing and graphical presentation of the results. GUI application in Python programming
language is implemented which is used to retrieve and display the data from database on interactive
map. This creates an expandable information-communication system for informing the
user about the traffic state and provides the possibility of optimizing the route for the fleet of
vehicles.
